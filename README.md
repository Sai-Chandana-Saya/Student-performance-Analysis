### **Project Overview**

I developed this project to analyze student quiz performance data and extract actionable insights. The main objective was to evaluate how well students perform across different topics and difficulty levels (trophy levels) and identify areas that require improvement. By processing and analyzing the data, I was able to uncover trends and make personalized recommendations for better learning outcomes.

The project focuses on:
1. **Data Extraction**:
   - I combined historical and current quiz data from provided APIs.
   - Key metrics like accuracy, improvement, and initial performance were calculated to evaluate performance trends.
   
2. **Performance Analysis**:
   - I grouped data by topics and trophy levels to identify strong and weak areas.
   - Metrics like `initial_perf` (initial performance) and `improvement` helped gauge student progress and identify areas needing more attention.

3. **Insights and Recommendations**:
   - For weak topics, I recommended focusing on lower trophy levels to strengthen foundational knowledge.
   - For topics with moderate performance, I suggested practicing mid-level quizzes to improve accuracy and confidence.
   - For topics with strong performance, I recommended advancing to higher-level quizzes to reinforce advanced understanding.

4. **Visualization**:
   - I visualized key performance metrics like accuracy, improvement, and initial performance across topics and trophy levels to better understand student behavior.

This project provides a comprehensive view of student performance and offers a systematic way to improve learning outcomes based on data-driven insights. Itâ€™s a step toward enabling personalized and targeted learning strategies.
